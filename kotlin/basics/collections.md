# Collections



A collection contains a number of objects (possibly zero) of the same type (and its subtypes).

There are three main collection types:



1. Lists https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collections-overview.html#list
   → ordered collection of items
   → store items in the order that they are added
   → allow for duplicate items
   → access an element in a list by index with the indexed access Operator
2. Sets https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collections-overview.html#set
   → unique unordered collection of times
   → no duplicates allowed, unique elements only
   → can't access an item by a particular index (because there is no order)
3. Maps https://kotlinlang.org/docs/collections-overview.html#map

   → store items as key-value pairs

   → every key in a map must be unique so that Kotlin can understand which value you want to get

   → it is possible to have duplicate values in a map (as long as they have different keys)

   → access an element in a map by key with the indexed Access operator



→ each collection type can be mutable or read only

→ to prevent unwanted modifications, the soution is to create a read-only view of a mutable list by assigning it to a List
