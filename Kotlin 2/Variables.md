# Variables



A variable is a **container** to store information (data).



A Variable is either **read-only** or **mutable**:

* **val** is used to declare a read-only variable → its value can not be reassigned after declaration and initialisation
* **var** is used to declare a mutable variable   → its value can be reassigned after declaration and initialisation



To assign a value to a variable, the **assignement Operator** is used '**=**'



A variable can be declared explicitly typed without initialization

A variable can be declared explicitly typed and initialized

A variable can be declared and initialized without explicit type because of type inference



A variable which has never been initialized can't be used
